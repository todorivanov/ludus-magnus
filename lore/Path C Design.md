# **Path C: The Explorer \- "The Hunter of Myths"**

**Theme:** Freedom, Discovery, and the Choice of Legacy.

**Timeline:** 193 AD (The Frontiers).

**Starting Status:** Free Agent (Mobile Caravan).

**Location:** The Rhodope Mountains (Thrace) \-\> The World Map.

## **1\. Character Origins (The "Free Agent")**

*Your background determines how you survive the wilds, but not where you go.*

### **A. The Venator (The Beast Master)**

* **Backstory:** You supplied the Colosseum with lions and bears for years. Now, you hunt the monsters they say don't exist.  
* **Starting Assets:** A reinforced **Iron Cage Wagon** and a tamed **Wolf Companion** (Combat Unit).  
* **Playstyle:** High risk, high reward. You capture enemies (beasts) instead of hiring them.  
* **Unique Item:** *The Hunter’s Whistle.* Summons your beast to the front line instantly.

### **B. The Merchant Prince (The Trader)**

* **Backstory:** A wealthy exile traveling with a private retinue. You fight for profit, not glory.  
* **Starting Assets:** 5,000 Denarii and a **Luxury Carriage** (Passive Morale regeneration for your team).  
* **Playstyle:** Diplomacy and Trade. You buy your way out of trouble.  
* **Unique Item:** *The Heavy Silver (Based on 1937 100 Leva).* A massive silver coin used to bribe high-level officials or skip combat encounters.

### **C. The Wandering Lanista (The Mobile Trainer)**

* **Backstory:** Your Ludus burned down, but your spirit didn't. You travel town to town, setting up temporary rings and training fighters in the mud.  
* **Starting Assets:** 3 Rookie Gladiators and a **Training Wagon** (Allows XP gain while traveling).  
* **Playstyle:** Growth. Your units level up faster than anyone else's.  
* **Unique Item:** *The Ancient Map.* Shows the location of a "Legendary Plot of Land" (The ultimate settlement spot).

## **2\. Gameplay Loop: The Caravan System**

*Your "Ludus" is on wheels. You have total freedom of movement, but you must manage the logistics of travel.*

### **2.1. The Mobile Base (Wagons)**

Instead of buildings, you upgrade your Wagons.

* **The Command Wagon:** Your mobile HQ. Upgrading this allows you to accept higher-tier contracts.  
* **The Supply Wagon:** Increases your food/water capacity. Essential for crossing deserts or mountains.  
* **The Armory Cart:** A mobile smithy. Repairs gear while you move.

### **2.2. The Freedom of Choice (Quests)**

You encounter "Nodes" on the map. You decide how to interact.

* **Scenario: The Bandit Toll**  
  * *Fight:* Enter a tactical grid battle. Loot their gear.  
  * *Pay:* Use "The Heavy Silver" to pass.  
  * *Recruit:* Intimidate them into joining your caravan as mercenaries.  
* **Scenario: The Ruined Temple**  
  * *Explore:* Risk injury to find artifacts.  
  * *Consecrate:* Spend resources to heal your party.  
  * *Ignore:* Move on to save time.

### **2.3. Provisions & Luxuries**

* **The Wine of the Valley (Midalidare Rose):**  
  * *Mechanic:* "Hydration." A crisp, acidic rose from the Karlovo valley. It clears "Heatstroke" and "Fatigue" statuses immediately. Essential for summer travel.

## **3\. Exploration & Artifacts (The Coin Collection)**

*You dig for the past to fund your future.*

### **Artifact A: The Silver Prince (Based on 1891 Ferdinand 2 Leva)**

* **Found:** In the ruins of a liberated fortress near the Danube.  
* **Description:** "A silver coin of high purity (83.5%). It bears the face of a young ruler and the mark 'KB'."  
* **Lore:** Legend says it belongs to a "Prince of the North" who liberated his people.  
* **Effect:** **"The Liberator."** If you carry this, escaping slaves/captives are 50% more likely to join you voluntarily instead of fleeing.

### **Artifact B: The King's Shield (Based on 1937 Boris 100 Leva)**

* **Found:** In a high-level tomb in the Rhodope mountains.  
* **Description:** "A heavy, large silver coin. The rim is inscribed with a prayer: *Gods Save the King*."  
* **Effect:** **"Divine Authority."** When you enter a new town, your "Reputation" starts at Level 3 instead of Level 0\. Guards salute you; shops open their special stock.

## **4\. The Pivot Point: "To Settle or To Roam?"**

*This is the unique mechanic of Path C. You can play the whole game as a nomad, OR you can transition.*

### **Step 1: The Acquisition**

You must find a "Deed."

* **The Coastal Villa (Capua):** Expensive, high prestige, close to markets.  
* **The Mountain Fort (Thrace):** Defensible, rugged, close to unique barbarian recruits.  
* **The City Block (Philippopolis):** Political hub, high corruption, high profit.

### **Step 2: The Transition Event**

When you click "Settle," the game transforms:

1. **Wagons become Buildings:** Your *Training Wagon* becomes a *Training Pit*. Your *Cage Wagon* becomes a *Beast Pen*.  
2. **Mercenaries become Gladiators:** Your paid staff sign contracts (or leave if they hate you).  
3. **UI Change:** The World Map becomes a "Region Map" (Lanista Mode), and you gain the "Lanista's Desk" UI.

### **Step 3: The Hybrid Advantage**

Because you started as an Explorer, your new Ludus has perks standard Lanistas don't have:

* **Exotic Stock:** You have beasts/fighters from regions others can't reach.  
* **Map Knowledge:** You can send "Caravans" out to trade automatically (Passive Income).  
* **The Artifacts:** You display your Coins in the atrium for massive Prestige bonuses.

## **5\. Special Event: The Seven Hills**

**Trigger:** Arriving at the city of Philippopolis.

**Event:** The city is built on seven syenite hills. You can choose one hill to explore for a unique boon.

* **Hill of the Watch (Sahat Tepe):** You find a vantage point. Reveals all "Bandit Camps" on the map for 30 days.  
* **Hill of the Bunardzhik:** You find a fresh spring and a statue of a "Giant" (Alyosha reference, adapted to Hercules). Fully heals your entire caravan.  
* **Hill of the Three (Trimontium):** You enter the ancient theater. You can hold a "Grand Exhibition" here to earn massive gold.
