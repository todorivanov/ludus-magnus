# **Ludus Magnus: Reborn \- The Chronicle of the Iron Year**

**The Era:** 193 AD \- "The Year of the Five Emperors"

**The Setting:** The Province of Thrace (Philippopolis/Trimontium) and Italia.

**The Theme:** "When the Wolf (Severus) fights the Lion (Niger), the Jackals (Lanistas) feast."

## **1\. Historical Context: The Crisis of 193 AD**

The game takes place during one of the most chaotic moments in Roman history. We adhere to the real timeline of events to ground the player's choices.

### **The Timeline of Ruin**

* **December 31, 192 AD:** Emperor **Commodus** is strangled in his bath by a wrestler named Narcissus. The "Golden Age" ends.  
* **January 1, 193 AD:** **Pertinax** is proclaimed Emperor. He tries to discipline the Praetorian Guard.  
* **March 28, 193 AD:** Pertinax is assassinated by mutinous guards.  
* **The Shameful Auction:** The Praetorian Guard sells the Empire to the highest bidder, **Didius Julianus**, for 25,000 sestertii per soldier.  
* **April 9, 193 AD:** **Septimius Severus**, governor of Pannonia Superior (the Danube frontier), is hailed Emperor by his troops. He begins the march on Rome.  
* **The Present Moment:** Severus is marching his legions through **Thrace** (The Balkans) to secure the East before turning to Rome. **Philippopolis** is the strategic key.

## **2\. The Setting: Trimontium (Ancient Plovdiv)**

While Capua is the tutorial area, the heart of the game is **Philippopolis**, known to the Romans as **Trimontium** ("The City of Three Hills").

### **Real Locations In-Game:**

1. **The Stadium of Trimontium:**  
   * *Real Fact:* One of the largest preserved Roman structures in the Balkans, seating 30,000 spectators.  
   * *In-Game:* This is the location of the "Grand Pythian Games" (Tier 3 Tournaments). It is famous for its curved northern end (The Sphendone).  
2. **The Temple of Apollo Kendrisos:**  
   * *Real Fact:* Located on the "Hill of the Nymphs" (Bunardzhik).  
   * *In-Game:* The central hub for the "Explorer" path. Here, you offer the **Bronze Coin of the Serpent** to receive blessings.  
3. **The Great Basilica:**  
   * *Real Fact:* A massive site with stunning mosaics.  
   * *In-Game:* Currently a pagan meeting ground for the **Syndicate of the Snake**, hidden beneath the guise of a merchant's guild.

## **3\. The Mythology of Objects (The User's Collection)**

We have adapted your real-world collection into "Lost Artifacts" that bridge the gap between history and legend.

### **I. The Coin of the Usurper (Bronze of Philippopolis)**

* **Real Object:** Bronze 20mm of Septimius Severus, minted in Philippopolis (193-211 AD).  
* **In-Game Item:** *The Bronze of the Serpent.*  
* **Lore:** "Minted mere days ago in the local foundry. It depicts the new claimant, Severus. On the reverse, the Tripod and Snake of Apollo—the patron god of this city."  
* **Function:** It serves as a **Passport**. The Danubian Legions control the roads. Showing this coin proves you are a "Severan Loyalist," allowing safe passage through military checkpoints.

### **II. The Icon of the Silver King (Silver Grosh)**

* **Real Object:** 14th Century Silver Grosh of Ivan Alexander.  
* **In-Game Item:** *The Medallion of the Priest-King.*  
* **Lore:** "An anachronistic marvel found in a Thracian tomb. It depicts two figures—a King and a Messiah—hammered in thin silver. The locals claim it prophesies a 'Tsar' who will rise 1,000 years from now."  
* **Function:** **Divine Right.** Holding this allows you to bypass the "reputation check" when recruiting legendary gladiators. They believe you are chosen by the gods.

### **III. The Prince's Silver (1891 2 Leva)**

* **Real Object:** 2 Leva 1891, Prince Ferdinand, KB mint mark.  
* **In-Game Item:** *The Coin of the Liberator.*  
* **Lore:** "A coin of impossible purity (83.5%). It bears the face of a beardless ruler and the mystic mark 'KB' (interpreted here as *Kabeiroi*, the ancient mystery cult of Samothrace)."  
* **Function:** **Liberation.** If you play as a Gladiator (Path A), finding this coin triggers the "Spartacus Event"—slaves in your Ludus will fight 50% harder if you promise them freedom.

### **IV. The Edge of Prayer (1937 100 Leva)**

* **Real Object:** 100 Leva 1937, Boris III, "God Save Bulgaria" edge inscription.  
* **In-Game Item:** *The Shield of the Last King.*  
* **Lore:** "A massive, heavy silver disk. The rim is etched with strange runes that translate to: *'Gods Save the Land.'* It feels heavier than it should, as if it carries the weight of a nation."  
* **Function:** **Sovereignty.** This is the **Victory Condition** item for the Lanista (Path B). You do not win by being rich; you win by burying this coin in the foundations of your Ludus, consecrating it as independent soil—a Kingdom within an Empire.

## **4\. The Culture of Wine (The Elixirs)**

We ground your preferences in the viticulture of 193 AD.

### **1\. The Blood of the Mountain (Prokupac)**

* **Ancient Name:** *Vinum Procopianum* (Fictionalized ancient root).  
* **Lore:** "A grape so old it remembers the footsteps of Dionysus. Grown in the rocky soil of the Western Balkans, it yields a wine that is dark, aggressive, and elegant."  
* **Game Effect:** **"The Berserker's Draught."** \+20% Strength, \-10% Defense. Causes the drinker to ignore pain (Health bars are hidden during combat).

### **2\. The Sun-White (Sauvignon Blanc)**

* **Ancient Name:** *Leucas Solis.*  
* **Lore:** "A wine of piercing acidity and 'green' notes, like crushed grass and elderflower. It is the preferred drink of the refined Senate wives in Rome, who find heavy reds too barbaric."  
* **Game Effect:** **"The Orator's Tongue."** \+30% Charisma in diplomatic negotiations. Essential for bribing Magistrates.

### **3\. The Rose of Tundzha (Midalidare Style)**

* **Ancient Name:** *Rosa Thraecia.*  
* **Lore:** "From the valley where the Tundzha river flows. This wine is pale pink, smelling of strawberries and wet stone. It is not fermented for power, but for clarity."  
* **Game Effect:** **"Clarity of Mind."** It is the only alcohol that *removes* status effects like "Confused" or "Poisoned."

## **5\. The Factions & The War**

The player is caught between three giants.

### **The Severan Legion (The Wolf)**

* **Leader:** Septimius Severus.  
* **Base:** Carnuntum (The Danube).  
* **Philosophy:** "Military Dictatorship." They despise politics. They respect strength.  
* **Player Interaction:** If you align with them, you get discounts on Weapons, but your fights must be bloody and short.

### **The Senate Loyalists (The Eagle)**

* **Leader:** Pescennius Niger (The Rival in the East).  
* **Base:** Byzantium.  
* **Philosophy:** "Tradition & Wealth." They love pageantry.  
* **Player Interaction:** If you align with them, you earn more Gold per match, but the crowd (The Mob) hates you for being a sellout.

### **The Thracian League (The Lion)**

* **Leader:** The "Masked King" (Secretly utilizing the symbolism of the Ivan Alexander/Boris coins).  
* **Base:** The Rhodope Mountains.  
* **Philosophy:** "Freedom." They want Rome out of Thrace.  
* **Player Interaction:** The hardest path. You fight guerilla wars. Your goal is to establish an independent Ludus.
