## **2\. Gameplay Loop: The Three Acts**

### **Act 1: The Pit (Survival)**

* **Objective:** Don't die. Pay off the "Interest" on your debt.  
* **Key Conflict:** The "Cellmate" system. You are chained to an NPC. If they die, your morale plummets. If you save them, they become a lifelong ally.  
* **The "Diet & Regimen" Subsystem:**  
  * *Barley Gruel:* Free, but provides no bonuses. High chance of "Fatigue" status.  
  * *The Black Grape (Prokupac):* A heavy, ancient red wine from the Balkans.  
    * **Effect:** \+20% Morale, \-5 Accuracy. Grants "Berserker" state if consumed before battle.  
  * *Rose of the Valley (Midalidare style):* A crisp, pink wine from the Thracian valley.  
    * **Effect:** \+15 Stamina Regeneration, \+1 Agility. A "Refined" drink that clears the "Hangover" debuff.

### **Act 2: The Arena (Glory)**

* **Objective:** Earn "Crowd Favor" (Dignitas) and pay down the Principal Debt.  
* **Class Selection:**  
  * *Murmillo:* Heavy shield, gladius. The tank.  
  * *Retiarius:* Net and trident. High risk, high reward.  
  * *Thraex:* Curved sica blade, small shield. Aggressive shield-breaker.  
* **The Patron System:**  
  * Magistrates will offer to sponsor you.  
  * *Dilemma:* A Patron demands you kill a surrendering opponent to please the Mob. Do you do it for the money, or spare him for Honor?

### **Act 3: The Primus (Freedom)**

* **Objective:** Win the *Rudis* (Wooden Sword of Freedom).  
* **The Final Boss:** You must face the **"Doctore"** (Your trainer) or a **Legendary Beast** (The Nemean Lion of Thrace).  
* **The Twist:** Even after winning, the Lanista may refuse to free you, triggering a "Spartacus" style escape scenario.

## **3\. Unique Mechanics for Path A**

### **The "Scars" System**

Gladiators accumulate permanent history on their bodies.

* **Eye Patch:** \-1 Accuracy, but \+2 Intimidation.  
* **Limp:** \-2 Speed, but \+1 Crowd Pity (The mob loves a survivor).  
* **Severed Finger:** Cannot use two-handed weapons.

### **The "Debt" Economy**

Unlike the Lanista, you start with *negative* wealth.

* **Winnings:** 80% goes to the Lanista, 20% to you.  
* **Side Hustles:** You can fight in illegal underground pits at night for 100% profit, but risk fatigue or death before official matches.

## **4\. Special Event: The Coin of Septimius**

*A multi-stage quest tied to the historical year 193 AD.*

**Stage 1: The Discovery**

After a bloody victory in the arena of Philippopolis, you find a coin half-buried in the sand.

* **Item:** *Bronze of Philippopolis (193 AD).*  
* **Visual:** Minted in the city of the Seven Hills. Obverse: Septimius Severus. Reverse: The Tripod and Snake of Apollo.  
* **Lore:** "This coin is fresh. It was minted *yesterday*. It means Severus is here, and he pays his troops in silver and bronze."

**Stage 2: The Antiquarian**

You meet a merchant named **Kaloyan** (an anachronistic nod to later history, or perhaps a local Thracian name). He notices the coin.

* *Option A:* Sell it for 500 Denarii (Immediate debt relief).  
* *Option B:* Keep it as a lucky charm (+2 Luck, "Apollo's Favor" trait).  
* *Option C:* Ask him about the symbols. He reveals a prophecy: "The Snake coils around the Tripod. Chaos comes, but the disciplined will rise." This unlocks the **"Severan Loyalist"** trait (Bonuses when fighting Praetorians).

## **5\. Expanded Characters & Lore**

### **Key NPCs**

* **Batiatus (The Lanista):** A man drowning in debt. He isn't evil, just desperate. He drinks cheap wine and gambles on your life.  
* **Crixus (The Rival):** The current Primus. He represents the "Old Guard." He hates the new tactical fighting style; he prefers brute force.  
* **Elissa (The Medicus):** A wise Dacian woman who knows herbalism. She can brew "Painkillers" (temp HP) if you bring her herbs from the Explorer mode (if unlocked) or buy them from merchants.

### **Random Encounters (The Life of a Slave)**

* **The Mess Hall Fight:** Someone steals your bread. Do you fight (risk injury) or let it go (lose Morale)?  
* **The Bathhouse:** You overhear a plot to assassinate the Emperor. Selling this info gives massive gold but makes you a target.  
* **The Letter:** You receive a letter from your family. They are starving. Do you send your meager savings to them, or buy a better helmet?

## **6\. Endgame Transition**

Once you earn your freedom, the game does not end. The UI unlocks the World Map.

### **Option 1: The Freelancer (Transition to Explorer Mode)**

* You keep your armor and the *Coin of Philippopolis*.  
* You leave the arena to explore the Rhodope Mountains.  
* **New Goal:** Find the "Silver of the Tsars" (A legend about a cache of silver hidden in the mountains, referencing the Ivan Alexander grosh lore but adapted to ancient times).

### **Option 2: The New Lanista (Transition to Lanista Mode)**

* You use your prize money to buy the very Ludus you were enslaved in.  
* You now manage your former oppressors.  
* **Trait:** *Legendary Teacher.* Your recruits gain XP 20% faster because you "lived it."
