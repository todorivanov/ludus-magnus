# **Path B: The Lanista \- "The Architect of Glory"**

**Theme:** Management, Ambition, and the Burden of Command.

**Timeline:** 193 AD (Civil War Era).

**Starting Status:** Owner of a Ludus (Quality varies by Origin).

**Location:** The Ruins of Philippopolis (Thrace) OR The Slums of Capua.

## **1\. Character Origins (The "Manager")**

*Your background determines your starting resources, reputation, and rivalries.*

### **A. The Heir (The Legacy)**

* **Backstory:** Your father was a legendary Lanista, but he died leaving massive debts and a crumbling school. The "Old Guard" respects the name, but the bank wants your blood.  
* **Starting Assets:** A large but ruined Ludus (Level 3 size, 20% condition).  
* **Bonus:** *Ancestral Doctore.* You start with a Level 10 Trainer who refuses to be paid until the debt is cleared.  
* **Unique Item:** *The Iron Key of the Ludus.* Unlocks a secret vault later in the game.

### **B. The Merchant (The Investor)**

* **Backstory:** You made a fortune trading grain and oil. You bought a Ludus because you see flesh as just another commodity. You have gold, but no respect.  
* **Starting Assets:** 10,000 Denarii (High Wealth), but 0 Dignitas (Reputation).  
* **Bonus:** *Mercantile Connections.* 20% discount on food and basic slaves.  
* **Unique Item:** *The Scales of Mercury.* Allows you to see the "True Value" (Hidden Potential) of slaves at auction.

### **C. The Retired Veteran (The Mentor)**

* **Backstory:** You are a former Primus (perhaps the character from Path A in a previous life) who earned the Rudis. You know fighting, not business.  
* **Starting Assets:** High Dignitas (The mob loves you), Low Gold (2000 Denarii).  
* **Bonus:** *Combat Drill.* All your gladiators gain \+10% XP in training.  
* **Unique Item:** *Your Old Rudis.* Can be gifted to a champion to instantly max their Morale.

## **2\. The Daily Loop: Purchase, Train, Fight**

*The core gameplay revolves around "The Lanista's Desk"—a UI hub where you manage your assets.*

### **2.1. Recruitment (The Markets)**

*You must constantly replenish your ranks. Gladiators die, retire, or are sold for profit.*

* **The Public Slave Market (The Low Road):**  
  * *Inventory:* Criminals, POWs, Debtors. Cheap (100-500 Denarii).  
  * *Risk:* Hidden traits (e.g., "Drunkard," "Coward," or "Tubercular"). You must pass a Medicine check to spot defects.  
  * *Gem:* Occasionally, you find a **Captured Thracian Royal** disguised as a common slave (High stats).  
* **The Private Auction (The High Road):**  
  * *Inventory:* Trained professionals, former soldiers. Expensive (2000+ Denarii).  
  * *Mechanic:* A bidding mini-game against rival Lanistas (like Cassius).  
  * *Item Synergy:* Using **The Scales of Mercury** here reveals the "Potential Max Level" of a recruit.  
* **The Scout Network:**  
  * Pay a scout to roam the frontier. They might return with a "Wild Man" (High Strength, 0 Discipline) or a "Deserter" (High Skill, Low Loyalty).

### **2.2. The Training Regimen**

*You assign a daily schedule to each gladiator slot. Balancing growth vs. injury.*

* **Morning: Physical Conditioning (Stats)**  
  * *Logs:* \+Strength (High Fatigue).  
  * *Running:* \+Stamina.  
  * *The Post (Palus):* \+Weapon Skill.  
* **Afternoon: Technical Drills (Classes)**  
  * *Doctore Supervision:* You assign your Doctore to a specific group.  
  * *Murmillo Group:* Focus on Shield Bash and Defense.  
  * *Retiarius Group:* Focus on Net Throwing and Agility.  
  * *Sparring:* 1v1 practice. High XP, but risk of accidental injury.  
* **Evening: Recovery & Diet**  
  * *The Menu:*  
    * **Barley:** Cheap. Maintains weight.  
    * **Meat & Fish:** Expensive. Increases muscle mass and healing.  
    * **The Black Wine (Prokupac):** Served only to the "Primus" tier. Boosts loyalty massively.

### **2.3. The Fight Assignments (The Dossier)**

*Every week, the Magistrate sends a list of requested matches (The Dossier).*

* **Contract Types:**  
  * **The Opener (Noon):** Low stakes. Good for rookies. Reward: Low Gold, Low Fame.  
  * **The Beast Hunt (Venatio):** High danger. Requires high Agility. Reward: Medium Gold, High Fame.  
  * **The Main Event (Primus):** Top tier only. Reward: Massive Gold, Political Favor.  
* **Strategy \- The Matchup:**  
  * You see the opponent's class. You must counter it.  
  * *Scenario:* The dossier asks for a fight against a **Heavy Murmillo**.  
  * *Choice:* Do you send your **Retiarius** (Good counter, but risky if he gets hit) or your own **Murmillo** (A boring slog, but safe)?  
  * *The Fix:* If you have bribed the Magistrate with **Sauvignon Blanc**, you can request a "Rule Change" (e.g., "No Shields") to favor your fighter.

## **3\. Diplomacy & Expansion**

### **The Wine Diplomacy System**

*Wines are not just for drinking; they are keys to political doors.*

* **Magistrate Valerius (The Traditionalist):** Loves **Prokupac**.  
  * *Gift:* Grants favorable referees (They ignore your fouls).  
* **Lady Aelia (The Socialite):** Loves **Sauvignon Blanc**.  
  * *Gift:* Invites your school to private, non-lethal exhibition matches (Safe XP).  
* **General Maximus (The Soldier):** Loves **Pinot Noir**.  
  * *Gift:* Allows you to buy "Legionary Surplus" weapons (Tier 3 gear).

### **The Artifact Collection**

*As a wealthy Lanista, you collect rare items to display in your Villa.*

1. **The Silver King (Based on Ivan Alexander Grosh):**  
   * *Effect:* **\+5% Passive Income.** (Pilgrims pay to see it).  
2. **The Lion's Shield (Based on the Ferdinand/Boris Coat of Arms):**  
   * *Effect:* **\+10 Defense** to all *Thraex* class gladiators.

## **4\. Special Event: The Syndicate of the Snake**

**Event:** You are approached by a secret society in Philippopolis that uses the **Tripod and Snake** (Apollo) as their symbol.

* **The Offer:** Rig the betting markets.  
* **The Risk:**  
  * *Accept:* Massive gold. You can buy the best gear.  
  * *Reject:* They fund your rival, **Cassius**.  
  * *Expose:* High risk of assassination, but potentially allows you to become Governor.

## **5\. Key NPCs & Rivals**

## **6\. Endgame Transition**
