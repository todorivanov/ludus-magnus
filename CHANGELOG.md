  - Injuries reduce value based on severity (permanent: -100g, major: -50g, minor: -25g)
  - Fatigue reduces value when high
  - Sell price now 70-80% of calculated value (up from 60-80%, less random variance)

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-05

Training XP calculation fix, Gladiator market refresh system, income calculation fixes.

### Fixed
- **Training XP Mismatch**: Fixed bug where actual XP gained was much lower than displayed estimate. The morale value was being passed incorrectly (raw 0.1-1.5 instead of converted 0-100 scale), causing calculations to use ~50% effectiveness instead of proper morale bonus
- **Stat Gains**: Same fix applied to stat gain calculations during training
- **Sponsorship Duration**: Sponsorship days remaining now decrements daily when ending the day (was stuck at initial value). Sponsorships will now properly expire when their duration ends

### Added
- **Cooldown Indicator**: Daily quests on cooldown now display remaining days (e.g., "⏳ 1 day left")

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-04

Quest system fix for proper progress initialization.

### Fixed
- **Quest Progress Initialization**: Fixed a timing issue where existing progress wasn't being applied when accepting quests. Initial progress is now calculated and applied atomically in a single Redux action, ensuring:
