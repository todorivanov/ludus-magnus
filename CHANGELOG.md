## [4.10.1] - 2026-01-13

### Added - Spawn Zone Validation System \ud83c\udfaf

**Strategic Spawn Positioning:**
- **Spawn Zones** - Dedicated areas for fighter placement
  - Player spawn zone: Bottom 2 rows (y=3, y=4)
  - Enemy spawn zone: Top 2 rows (y=0, y=1)
- **Terrain Validation** - Prevents spawning on impassable terrain
  - No spawning on walls (\ud83e\uddf1)
  - No spawning on pits (\u26ab)
  - Only passable terrain allowed for initial placement
- **Smart Fallback System** - Ensures fighters always spawn successfully
  - Tries preferred position first (player: 0,4 | enemy: 4,0)
  - Falls back to random valid position in spawn zone
  - Final fallback scans entire spawn row
  - Logs warnings if placement fails

**Strategic Benefits:**
- \ud83d\udee1\ufe0f **Protect Squishies** - Position mages behind tanks in spawn zone
- \ud83c\udfaf **Tactical Setup** - Choose advantageous starting positions
- \u26d3\ufe0f **Bug Fix** - No more spawning on walls that restrict movement
- \ud83e\udde0 **AI Intelligence** - AI also gets valid spawn positions

**Technical Implementation:**
- `GridManager.getValidSpawnZones(side)` - Get all valid positions for a side
- `GridManager.placeFighter(fighter, x, y)` - Validates terrain passability
- `GridCombatIntegration.placeFightersInitial()` - Smart placement with fallbacks
- `GridCombatIntegration.getSpawnZonePositions(side)` - Helper for UI/testing

**API Reference:**
```javascript
// Get valid spawn positions
const playerSpawns = gridManager.getValidSpawnZones('player');
const enemySpawns = gridManager.getValidSpawnZones('enemy');

// Place fighter (with automatic validation)
const success = gridManager.placeFighter(fighter, x, y);
if (!success) {
  console.warn('Cannot spawn on impassable terrain!');
}

// Get spawn zone info for UI
const spawnZones = gridCombatIntegration.getSpawnZonePositions('player');
```
