## Tips & Tricks

### ✅ **DO**
- **Plan ahead**: Look at full tree before spending points
- **Max foundation talents first**: Rank 5 talents are most efficient
- **Specialize**: Focus on one tree initially
- **Experiment**: Try different builds for different content
- **Respec for hard content**: Optimize for specific fights

### ❌ **DON'T**
- **Spread too thin**: Don't put 1-2 points in every talent
- **Ignore prerequisites**: Plan path to capstone talents
- **Forget to respec**: Don't stick with bad build if not working
- **Skip foundation talents**: They're the most cost-effective
- **Learn without reading**: Always check talent effects first

- Passive effects don't scale (binary on/off)

**Execute + Precise Strikes + Bladestorm**
- High crit chance
- Massive crit damage
- Execute for finishing blow
- Result: One-shot potential

**Ignite + Combustion + Critical Mass**
- High crit to trigger ignite
- Combustion makes it explode
- Result: Massive AoE burst

**Shield Block + Shield Wall + Toughness**
- High HP pool
- 30% block chance
- Damage reflection
- Result: Unkillable tank
